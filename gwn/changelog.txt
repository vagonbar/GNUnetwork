Events:
  - created subclasses of Event in module gwnevent.
  - class EventComm converts MAC addresses.
  - mkevent() not useful when subclasses contain specific fields, e.g. EventComm; use of class constructor requires specifying ev_type, ev_subtype, losing benefit of nickname, which maps to corresponding ev_type, ev_subtype.

Events:
  - suppressed subclasses, all events are Event objects,
  - except IEEE 802.11 frames, still with their own subclasses.
  - tests run.
  - TODO:
    - decouple framing from events, frames are of different forms;
      if subclasses are required or convenient, define a way to subclass.
    - revise nicknames, types and subtypes. One possible scheme:
        nickname, a convenient way of recognizing a certain kind of event.
        type: one of Config, Timer, Mgmt, Ctrl, Data, ... (predefined);
          not forced, but agreed upon.
        subtype: as deemed most descriptive.


2014-10-06  VGB
Events:
  - created evdata, evctrl, evmgmt modules: classes EventData, EventCtrl, EventData.
  - changed evrequest.EventRequest into evconfig.EventConfig; adjusted in other
    modules; tests run.
  - changed api_events to include the former changes.
  - pending:
    - fill or review ev_dc dictionaries of type, subtype, class in modules evdata, evctrl, evmgmt.
    - adjust evconfig.ev_dc: existing types EventConsumerStatus, TimerConfig;
      types to include: set, get, status (as input events); reply (as output
      event).
