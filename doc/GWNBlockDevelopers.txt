The GWN Block developer's manual




To create a new block:
  1. Define new block as a subclass of GWNBlock.
     See doc of GWNBlock for description of attributes and functions inherited.
  2. Overwrite constructor (optional)
     Set blkid, blkname : block identifier, block name.
     Set number of inputs, outputs and timers.
     Add parameters and attributes as necessary, initialize.
  3. Overwrite body of process_data function.
     Preserve signature of process_data function, to receive all information.
     Function process_data is called this way:
       process_data(port_type, port_nr, ev)
     Function process_data defines transformations occuring in this block.
     Function process_data is called on each event received on any of the inputs to this block.
     Information received as arguments (actual parameters):
       event : event received.
       port_type, port_nr : port type and number on which event was received.
     Use:
       function write_out to output events on any output of the block.


To test a new block (draft):
This procedure creates a doctest file independent of module where new block is defined.

  1. Create a module <new_block_name>.tst
  2. Create generator blocks to connect to each of the inputs of new block.
  3. Create consumer blocks to connect each output of new block.
  4. Run as
       python -m doctest <new_block_name>.tst
  5. Verify output, include correct output in doctest file.
